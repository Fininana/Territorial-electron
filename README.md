# Territorial.io Electron App

![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Fininana/Territorial-electron)

This project is a personal exploration into using Electron to port the [territorial.io](https://territorial.io/) website/game into a desktop application. The aim is to provide a seamless experience for users who prefer desktop versions over web interfaces. While the current version offers a simple port, there are plans for further enhancements and additions.

## Features & To-Do

The application currently serves as a wrapper around the Territorial.io website, but there are several planned features:

- [ ] Custom CSS window
- [ ] Better UI
- [ ] More features (TBD)

## Download

For the latest stable version of the application, visit the [releases](https://github.com/Fininana/Territorial-electron/releases) page.
